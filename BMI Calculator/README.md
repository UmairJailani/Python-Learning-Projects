## 🧮 BMI Calculator

A simple Python program that calculates your **Body Mass Index (BMI)** based on your height and weight.  
It works with both **meters** and **centimeters** for height input.

### 📘 About BMI

The **Body Mass Index (BMI)** is a number used to check if a person has a healthy body weight for their height.

**Formula:**

BMI = weight(kg) / (height(m))²

Height is **squared** to balance out the natural increase in weight with height, making BMI fair for all body types.

### 🧠 How It Works

1. The program asks whether your height is in **meters** or **centimeters**.
2. Converts it to meters (if needed).
3. Calculates your BMI.
4. Displays your BMI value and category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, etc.).

### 🧩 Example Output

Enter your height: 177
Enter your weight in kg: 85
Your BMI is: 27.13
You are overweight
