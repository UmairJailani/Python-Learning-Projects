# 🐍 Python Learning Projects

This repository contains all the **Python projects** I create while learning from the **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu**.  
Each folder represents a different mini-project or concept I’ve practiced during my learning journey.

## 📘 About This Repository
  - Focused on **hands-on learning** through real Python projects  
  - Covers beginner to intermediate topics such as:
  - Variables, loops, and conditionals  
  - Functions and data structures  
  - File handling and error management  
  - Web scraping and automation (coming soon!)  
  - Basic game logic and GUI apps  

## 🧩 Example Projects
| Project | Description |

| **BMI Calculator** | Calculates your Body Mass Index (BMI) and classifies your weight category. |
| *(More projects will be added soon)* | Stay tuned for more as I progress through the course! |

## 🚀 Purpose
This repo tracks my **progress and practice** as I learn Python step by step.  
It’s a collection of small but meaningful projects to build real coding confidence.

## 🧠 How to Run a Project

1. Clone this repository:
