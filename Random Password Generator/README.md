# 🔐 PyPassword Generator

A simple Python program that generates **strong, random passwords** with letters, numbers, and symbols.
This beginner-friendly project helps you practice **Python basics**, **randomization**, and **user input handling** while creating something practical you can use immediately.

## 🎮 How It Works

1. The program asks you how many **letters**, **numbers**, and **symbols** you want in your password.
2. It randomly selects characters from predefined lists of **letters**, **numbers**, and **symbols**.
3. Combines them into a single password and **shuffles** it to make it unpredictable.
4. Prints the final password on the screen for you to copy and use.

Every run creates a **unique password**, so your passwords are always strong and different!

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Lists and list operations
- Loops (`for`)
- Random module (`random.choice`, `random.shuffle`)
- String manipulation and `.join()`
- Input and output handling

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure **Python 3.x** is installed on your system.
2. Run the script in your terminal or IDE:
3. Enter the number of letters, symbols, and numbers you want.
4. Copy and use your generated password immediately.
