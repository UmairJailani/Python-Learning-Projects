# ✊📄✂️ Rock–Paper–Scissors Game

A simple command-line **Rock–Paper–Scissors** game built in Python.  
The player chooses Rock (0), Paper (1), or Scissors (2), and the computer randomly picks one.  
ASCII art is used to display each choice visually.

---

## 🎮 How It Works

1. Player chooses:
   - **0** → Rock
   - **1** → Paper
   - **2** → Scissors
2. The computer randomly selects a choice using `random.randint(0, 2)`.
3. ASCII art displays both choices.
4. A series of `if/elif` conditions decide the winner.
